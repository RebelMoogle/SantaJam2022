# SantaJam 2022

This is an unfinished Game Project for SantaJam 2022. I'm mostly just putting it here for posterity. It was supposed to be an async counter-coop horror game with ducks. (THe ducks might be evil, who knows) Unfortunately I got covid at the beginning of the Jam and lost about 75% of time to work on it :/

You can do with it whatever you want, it's not really functional, but includes a fun cyberpunk glasses and simple low-poly duckmodel. :) 

I might come back to this later and finish it, who knows!
